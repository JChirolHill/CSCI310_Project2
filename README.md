To run this app, download the attached zip file, or, if one is not attached, go to https://github.com/JChirolHill/CSCI310_Project2 , click on the green button on the right side of the page. Choose "Download Zip". Open the file location of the zip folder, and unzip it. Remember the file location of this unzipped folder. 

Open Android Studio. Click on File --> Open. In the pop-up, find the file location of the file you just unzipped. Then click "OK".

Once the project loads and finishes building properly, you will next choose the device emulator that this app will run on. At the top of the IDE, to the left of the green triangle (the play button), select "Pixel 2 API 27". After you have selected the emulator version,
hit the green play button to the right of the version selector.  This will launch an emulator. The emulator may take some time to launch, so be patient. The Bean and Leaf app should automatically launch, but if for some reason it does not, hit the center dot on the bottom to go to the home page of the emulator. Then click on the up arrow to find all the apps. Finally, click on the "Bean and Leaf" icon (a round coffee mug). Then app will then launch. 


### Note:
Since claiming a store (as a merchant) requires taking a picture of verification documents, the emulator will crash if you try to take a picture with it (by clicking the Capture button on the Claim Shop Activity).  If you would like to test the claiming a shop functionality, we can provide a demo or please use a real Android device to run the app.
