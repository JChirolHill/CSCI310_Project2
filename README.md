To run this app, download the attached zip file, or, if one is not attached, go to https://github.com/JChirolHill/CSCI310_Project2 , click on the green button on the right side of the page. Choose "Download Zip". Open the file location of the zip folder, and unzip it. Remember the file location of this unzipped folder. 

Open Android Studio. Click on File --> Open. In the pop-up, find the file location of the file you just unzipped. Then click "OK".

Once the project loads and finishes building properly, you will next choose the device emulator that this app will run on. At the top of the IDE, to the left of the green triangle (the play button), select "Pixel 2 API 27". After you have selected the emulator version,
hit the green play button to the right of the version selector.  This will launch an emulator. The emulator may take some time to launch, so be patient. Once the emulator launches, we will need to ensure that the permissions are set up properly. Hit the round button on the bottom center of the emulator. Hit the arrow pointing up about 3/4 way down the phone screen to bring up all the apps. Scroll down to the "Settings" icon. It's a green circle with a white gear on it. Click on "App & Notification," then click on "App Permissions". In App Permissions, go to "Camera". Next to "Bean and Leaf", make sure that the green button is selected to give them app permission to use the camera. Then go back one level and go to "Location". Likewise, make sure "Bean and Leaf" is selected to give the app Location permissions. 

We can now relaunch the Bean and Leaf app. Go to the main menu by hitting the center bottom circle again. Hit the up arrow to bring up the menu of all the apps, then click on the "Bean and Leaf" icon. The app will then launch.


### Note:
Since claiming a store (as a merchant) requires taking a picture of verification documents, the emulator will crash if you try to take a picture with it (by clicking the Capture button on the Claim Shop Activity).  If you would like to test the claiming a shop functionality, we can provide a demo or please use a real Android device to run the app.
