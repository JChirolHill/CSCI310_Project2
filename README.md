To run this app, download the project and open it with Android Studio.  

Once the project loads and finishes building properly, run it with the green play button at the top of the IDE.  This will launch an emulator with the app and you can preview the app on this.

### Note:
Since claiming a store (as a merchant) requires taking a picture of verification documents, the emulator will crash if you try to take a picture with it (by clicking the Capture button on the Claim Shop Activity).  If you would like to test the claiming a shop functionality, we can provide a demo or please use a real Android device to run the app.
